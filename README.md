# Image Classification using CNN

## Project Description

This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained to classify images into one of 10 classes.

## Features

- **Load Data**: Load and preprocess CIFAR-10 image data.
- **Train Model**: Train a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 training dataset.
- **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the trained model on the CIFAR-10 test dataset.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive notebook for visualizing the image classification process.
